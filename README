This is the minihost example from Steinberg VSTSDK-2.4, with added support for building on Linux

I'm not completely sure about the License here, if Steinberg will disapprove of this or it's ok to publish modified example code

In any case, as for my code it's provided as-is, free as in beer, use it as you wish, I won't be liable for any damages etc etc

You might need to adjust VST_SDK in the Makefile, to point to where you have your vstsdk2.4
